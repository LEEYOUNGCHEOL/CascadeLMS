These instructions are for setting up a developer workstation for CSCW.
It is best to develop on Mac OS X or Linux (even if it is in a virtual machine, or if Cygwin is used).

0) Install the Subversion client
  http://subversion.tigris.org/

1) Install Ruby, Gems, and Rails
It is best to follow the instructions for your platform as described here -> http://rubyonrails.org/down

2) Install OpenLDAP -> http://www.openldap.org/
(For windows, it is easier to get a binary distro http://download.bergmans.us/openldap/openldap-2.2.29/)
  
3) Install MySql -> http://www.mysql.com

4) Install the necessary Ruby Gems (add sudo before each command if on a unix(-like) platform )
  sudo gem install daemons slave  
  sudo gem install gem_plugin mongrel mongrel_cluster --include-dependencies
  sudo gem install mysql
  sudo gem install RedCloth
  sudo gem install diff-lcs

5) Patch rails - You must patch the Rails source by hand
The comment on line 75 and the if statement on lines 76-78 to read

# This is an uploaded file. 
if value.respond_to?(:original_filename) && !value.original_filename.blank?

This allows users with the Safari 3 browser to use the site

6) Install the Ruby LDAP library 
** OpenSSL and LDAP development libraries must be installed already

cd ~/src
curl -O http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ruby-ldap/ruby-ldap-0.9.7.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-ldap-0.9.7.tar.gz
cd ruby-ldap-0.9.7
ruby extconf.rb
make
sudo make install

7) Grab the source and begin to configure the application (This assumes a dev path of ~/src/cscw/ )

mkdir -p ~/src/cscw
cd ~/src/cscw
mkdir storage
svn co https://svn.csi.muohio.edu/cscourseware/trunk cscourseware

8) Create mysql database and grant access to your user (fill in database username as appropriate)
* also, you may want to omit the identified by... part so that your DB doesn't need a password

mysqladmin -u root -p create cscourseware_dev
mysql -u root -p
grant all on cscourseware_production.* to DATABASEUSER@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

9) Change the cscw database configuration

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/config
cp database.yml.todo database.yml

Edit the database.yml file and configure the development database appropriatley

10) Load the database 

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/
rake db:migrate

11) Start the server

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/
ruby script/server

12) Configure the app

Log in to CSCW using the 
 username: admin
 password: password

Immeadiatly click on "admin admin" in the upper right hand corner to change your password and assign 
a valid email address to the admin user

Click on "Adminstration -> Settings"
* This will let you configure display options, title, organization, email addresses, etc...
******** Please configure an appropriate error reporting email address

Also be sure to configure the appropriate location of your Java compiler and JVM, as
well as the Ruby interpreter that can be called externally.

There is also a configuration option for external storage - be sure to 
configure this and make it a secure location, we suggest
  /srv/www/rails/cscourseware/storage


You can now create users and courses from the administration tab


13) Please see the application's Web site - www.cscourseware.org
   for information on submitting patches
