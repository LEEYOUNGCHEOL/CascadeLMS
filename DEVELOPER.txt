These instructions are for setting up a developer workstation for CascadeLMS.
It is best to develop on Mac OS X or Linux (even if it is in a virtual machine, or if Cygwin is used).

0) Install the Git client
   http://git-scm.com/download

1) Install Ruby, Gems, and Rails
It is best to follow the instructions for your platform as described here -> http://rubyonrails.org/down

2) Install OpenLDAP -> http://www.openldap.org/   -- If you want to use LDAP
(For windows, it is easier to get a binary distro http://download.bergmans.us/openldap/openldap-2.2.29/)
  
3) Install MySql -> http://www.mysql.com 
   Latest version 5.x

4) Install the necessary Ruby Gems (add sudo before each command if on a unix(-like) platform )
  sudo gem install daemons slave  
  sudo gem install gem_plugin mongrel mongrel_cluster --include-dependencies
  sudo gem install mysql
  sudo gem install RedCloth
  sudo gem install diff-lcs

5) Install the Ruby LDAP library 
** OpenSSL and LDAP development libraries must be installed already

cd ~/src
curl -O http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/ruby-ldap/ruby-ldap-0.9.7.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-ldap-0.9.7.tar.gz
cd ruby-ldap-0.9.7
ruby extconf.rb
make
sudo make install

7) Grab the source and begin to configure the application
   The repository is here -> http://github.com/mikehelmick/CascadeLMS/tree/master

8) Create mysql database and grant access to your user (fill in database username as appropriate)
* also, you may want to omit the identified by... part so that your DB doesn't need a password

mysqladmin -u root -p create cscourseware_dev
mysql -u root -p
grant all on cscourseware_production.* to DATABASEUSER@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

9) Change the cscw database configuration

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/config
cp database.yml.todo database.yml

Edit the database.yml file and configure the development database appropriately

10) Load the database 

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/
rake db:migrate

11) Start the server

cd ~/src/cscw/cscourseware/
ruby script/server

12) Configure the app

Log in to CSCW using the 
 username: admin
 password: password

Immediately click on "admin admin" in the upper right hand corner to change your password and assign 
a valid email address to the admin user

Click on "Administration -> Settings"
* This will let you configure display options, title, organization, email addresses, etc...
******** Please configure an appropriate error reporting email address

Also be sure to configure the appropriate location of your Java compiler and JVM, as
well as the Ruby interpreter that can be called externally.

There is also a configuration option for external storage - be sure to 
configure this and make it a secure location, we use
  /srv/www/rails/CascadeLMS/storage

You can now create users and courses from the administration tab

13) Please see the application's Web site - www.CascadeLMS.org
   for information on submitting patches
