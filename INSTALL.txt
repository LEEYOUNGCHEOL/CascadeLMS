Part 0 - Version History

Version 0.8.1 (Paperweight) - 20080815
 * First public release 

Part 1 - Prerequisites

Computer Science CourseWare (hereafter CSCW) is know to run on both Mac OS X and Linux.   
At least one of the third party libraries used is not currently compatible with any
Windows based operating system.

This document assumes that you are stating with a basic working server configuration 
including:
 * Apache 2 with mod_proxy_balancer
 * Mysql 4 or 5
 * Subversion with SSL support
 * A c/c++ compiler (gcc)
 * curl (to download some of the setup files)

And that you have SUDO access

You will be installing Ruby 1.8.6 and Rails 1.2.3 (latest releases as of this writing).  
A few third party add-ons to Ruby will also be installed, again please try to follow this document
in order.

Part 2 - Installation

Step 01 - Setup Path

 Check your path - make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your path

# echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

 If it is NOT in your path

Add this line to your ~/.bash_login file

export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Step 02 - Install Ruby

Set up your src directory

# cd ~
# mkdir src
# chmod -R 775 src/
# cd src

** You can change "src" in the above script, whatever directory you like, just remember it later.

Install Readline (Required for Ruby)

curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-5.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf readline-5.1.tar.gz
cd readline-5.1
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
cd ..

Install Ruby 1.8.6 

curl -O ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6.tar.gz
tar xzvf ruby-1.8.6.tar.gz
cd ruby-1.8.6
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-pthread --with-readline-dir=/usr/local --enable-shared
make
sudo make install
sudo make install-doc
cd ..

Verify Ruby install

# ruby -v
ruby 1.8.6 (2007-03-13 patchlevel 0) [i686-linux]

Install Ruby Gems

curl -O http://files.rubyforge.mmmultiworks.com/rubygems/rubygems-0.9.4.tgz
tar xzvf rubygems-0.9.4.tgz
cd rubygems-0.9.4
sudo /usr/local/bin/ruby setup.rb
cd ..

Install Ruby on Rails (current release - currently 1.2.3)

sudo gem install rails --include-dependencies

Install Mongrel (Ruby Web server)

sudo gem install daemons gem_plugin mongrel mongrel_cluster --include-dependencies

When prompted, select mongrel 1.0.1 (ruby) and fastthread 1.0 (ruby)

Install the MySQL native extensions
* not required - but will considerably boost performance

sudo gem install mysql


** At this point we are ready to actually install and configure the application.
You need to decide where to install it, we recommend the path /srv/www/rails/cscourseware/

sudo mkdir -p /srv/www/rails/cscourseware
cd /srv/www/rails/cscourseware
sudo mkdir storage
sudo svn co https://mikehelmick.com/svn/cscourseware/trunk current


Part 3 - Configuration

Create the database

mysqladmin -u root -p create cscourseware_production

Create the user for the database - you will need to do this in MySQL
-- You can create your own username and password by filling in the details below

mysql -u root -p
grant all on cscourseware_production.* to DATABASEUSER@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

Change CSCW datase configuration

cd /srv/www/rails/cscourseware/current/config/
