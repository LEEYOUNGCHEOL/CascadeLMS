<p class="blockintro">The CRN number is used for auto-enrollment.  A course can exist without one entered, but it is recommended to enter one.   Use the full CRN number, for example '20063012345' to represent course number '12345' in term '200630'.  If a course has multiple CRN numbers, you should create a course with each, and then combine the courses (for example a cross-listed graduate/undergraduate course) as this will preserve  both course numbers.</p>
