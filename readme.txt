Computer Science Courseware (CSCW) is an integrated online courseware application.

CSCW covers most aspects of course management.    In addition, CSCW is capable of automatically grading student computer programs (currently just in Java).

CSCW is under active development, and we welcome new contributers.


CSCW has MANY dependencies.

Some programs need to be installed and in your path already, these include:
 - Subversion (Optional - strongly recommended)
 - MySQL (5+ recommended)


These will be automatically downloaded, installed, and built for you.

Dependencies include
 - Ruby 1.8.5  (installed in /usr/local)
 - Rails 1.2.2 (installed in /usr/local)
 - Ruby Gems
